# ðŸŽ­ Playwright | AutomationTest | UI Framework

## Tech Details

- Playwright - Playwright is a cross-browser automation library for Node.js. It enables you to write reliable end-to-end tests for web applications and websites. With Playwright, you can automate scenarios across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Allure - Allure is a flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation of what have been tested in a neat web report form, but allows everyone participating in the development process to extract maximum of useful information from everyday execution of tests.

This patch allows passing 0 to disable timeout for the following methods:

```typescript
await page.goto(`http://www.goole.com.au`, { timeout: 0 });
await page.waitForSelector(`a[href='/signup']`, { visible: true });
```

- page.goto
- page.waitForNavigation
- page.goForward
- page.goBack

### Docker container run

```bash

## API Testing with Playwright

This repository now includes support for testing REST APIs using Playwright. You can use the provided helper functions to perform HTTP GET, POST, and PATCH requests, and write your own API tests.

### Helper Functions

The following helper functions are available in `src/core/apiHelpers.ts`:

- `HttpGet(url: string, headers?: Record<string, string>)`: Perform an HTTP GET request.
- `HttpPost(url: string, data: any, headers?: Record<string, string>)`: Perform an HTTP POST request.
- `HttpPatch(url: string, data: any, headers?: Record<string, string>)`: Perform an HTTP PATCH request.

### Sample API Tests

Sample API tests are available in `src/tests/api.test.spec.ts`. These tests demonstrate how to use the helper functions to perform API requests and validate the responses.

### Running API Tests

To run the API tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test src/tests/api.test.spec.ts
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed by running:

```bash
yarn install
```
